# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Analyze and predict rocket launch success using SpaceX Falcon 9 data through data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models.

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze and predict the success of rocket launches using data from SpaceX's Falcon 9 missions. The primary objective is to assist SpaceY, a rival company to SpaceX, in determining the factors contributing to successful rocket first stage landings and to estimate the costs associated with these launches. The project encompasses data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Collection
- **SpaceX API:** Collected launch data directly from SpaceX's public API to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Web Scraping:** Employed web scraping techniques to gather additional data on Falcon 9 launches from various online sources.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Performed thorough data cleaning to handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and irrelevant data.
- Standardized data for uniformity and ease of analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualization:** Utilized libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations that highlight key trends and patterns in the launch data.
- **SQL:** Conducted EDA using SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and derive meaningful insights from the data.

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Implemented multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN.
- Optimized model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to achieve the best performance.
- Evaluated models using accuracy scores and confusion matrices to compare their effectiveness in predicting launch success.

### 5. Results Visualization
- Created visualizations to compare the accuracy of different models, providing a clear understanding of model performance.
- Generated a comprehensive bar chart showcasing the accuracy of all built classification models.

## Usage
